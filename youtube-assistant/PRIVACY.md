# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** September 1, 2025

This extension ("the Extension") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension handles user data.

## Information Collection and Use
- The Extension does **not** collect, transmit, or share personal information with the developer or any third party.
- The Extension requires the user to provide their own API key to access external services. This key is stored **locally on the user's device** and is never transmitted to the developer.
- The Extension may send video transcript text to the external AI API **only when initiated by the user**. These requests go directly from the user's browser to the external API service.

## Storage
- The Extension uses local storage to save:
  - User-provided API keys  
  - User preferences (such as overlay visibility and theme)  
- No personal data is collected or sent elsewhere.

## Permissions
- **Host Permissions:** Limited to YouTube domains in order to display overlays with transcripts, summaries, and quizzes.  
- **Storage Permission:** Used only to save user preferences and the API key locally.  
- **Remote Code:** The Extension communicates with external APIs using the userâ€™s API key. No arbitrary or third-party code is executed.

## Data Security
- All sensitive information (like the API key) is stored only on the user's device.  
- The Extension does not include any analytics, tracking scripts, or third-party code.  

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Updates will be reflected in the version history of the Extension.
